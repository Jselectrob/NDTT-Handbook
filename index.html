      title: "Welcome to NDTT",
      body: `<h2>About This Game</h2>
<p>NDTT (Non-Descript Table Top RPG) is a community-driven fantasy role-playing game that empowers players to create their own custom classes, races, backstories, items, weapons, campaigns, and abilities. The core philosophy is creative freedom balanced with fair gameplay.</p>

<h3>What Makes This Different?</h3>
<p>NDTT features a unique Ability Point system that allows players to literally build their own abilities from scratch. Every character is truly unique, shaped by the player's imagination and strategic choices. The game grows with your character across multiple campaigns, creating a persistent hero that ages and evolves with you.</p>

<h3>Character Creation Overview</h3>
<p>Characters are built using six core attributes and a pool of Ability Points that you spend to create your own custom abilities. Higher-cost abilities are more powerful but harder to successfully execute, creating natural balance through risk vs. reward.</p>

<h3>Campaign Persistence</h3>
<p>Your character is locked during a campaign but carries forward to future adventures. Between campaigns, you can respec abilities, allowing your character to grow and adapt while maintaining continuity across your gaming experience.</p>`
    },
    
    rules: {
      title: "Core Rules",
      body: `<h2>Core Attributes</h2>
<p>Every character has six core attributes that define their capabilities:</p>

<p><strong>Strength (STR)</strong> - Physical power and combat prowess. Adds directly to physical damage dealt.</p>

<p><strong>Defense (DEF)</strong> - Overall defensive capability, encompassing dodge, armor, and damage reduction.</p>

<p><strong>Vitality (VIT)</strong> - Health points (HP). Determines how much damage you can take before falling.</p>

<p><strong>Intelligence (INT)</strong> - Mental acuity and magical power. Adds directly to magic-based damage.</p>

<p><strong>Wisdom (WIS)</strong> - Perception, insight, and magical understanding. Adds directly to magic-based damage.</p>

<p><strong>Charisma (CHA)</strong> - Force of personality, persuasiveness, and leadership ability.</p>

<h2>Ability Point System</h2>
<p>The heart of NDTT's character customization is the Ability Point system. Players use these points to create their own unique abilities.</p>

<h3>Ability Point Progression</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Points:</strong> 10 ability points at character creation</p>
<p><strong>Level Gain:</strong> +2 ability points per level</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Cap:</strong> 30 ability points total</p>

<h3>Creating Abilities</h3>
<p>When you create an ability, you spend ability points from your pool. The more points you invest, the more powerful the ability becomes.</p>

<p><strong>Important Balance Mechanic:</strong> Higher-cost abilities are more powerful but HARDER to successfully execute. They require higher dice rolls to hit/succeed, creating a natural risk vs. reward system.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> If you spend all 10 starting points on one devastating ability, it will be incredibly powerful but very difficult to land without a high roll. Alternatively, you could create five 2-point abilities that are weaker but more reliable.</p>

<h3>Using Abilities in Combat</h3>
<p>When you use an ability, it costs resources (typically HP, Defense, or other stats). The player chooses what resource is consumed based on the nature of the ability - a blood magic spell might cost HP, while a defensive technique might temporarily reduce Defense.</p>

<p><strong>Dice Resolution:</strong> NDTT uses a d20 for ability checks and combat resolution.</p>

<h3>Ability Modifications</h3>
<p><strong>During Campaign:</strong> Characters are locked - you cannot respec existing abilities, but you CAN create new abilities as you gain ability points from leveling.</p>

<p><strong>Between Campaigns:</strong> Before starting a new campaign, you can respec your abilities, changing their power and cost to better fit your evolving strategy.</p>

<h2>Combat System</h2>
<p>NDTT uses a traditional turn-based combat system with d20 resolution.</p>

<h2>Character Advancement</h2>
<p>Characters level up through experience, gaining +2 ability points per level. Your character persists across campaigns, aging and growing more powerful with each adventure.</p>

<h2>Mechanics In Development</h2>
<p>The following systems are still being refined:</p>
<p>• Exact ability power scaling formulas</p>
<p>• Minimum/maximum damage ranges based on ability point investment</p>
<p>• Elemental affinity integration</p>
<p>• Detailed combat mechanics</p>`

<h2>Custom Race Guidelines</h2>
<p><strong>Balance:</strong> Custom races should be balanced with pre-existing races. They should not have abilities or traits that are overwhelmingly powerful.</p>
<p><strong>Game Lore Continuity:</strong> Custom races should fit within the existing game lore and world-building. They should have a proper backstory, culture, and place in the game's existing world (or custom world).</p>
<p><strong>Game Experience:</strong> Custom races should enhance the game experience for all players and not detract from it.</p>
<p><strong>Realism:</strong> Custom races should be believable within the context of the game's fantasy setting. They should have clear and consistent explanations of their abilities and traits.</p>
<p><strong>Originality:</strong> Custom races should be original. Inspiration is encouraged, but if making a sub-race or offshoot of someone else's design, they must be credited.</p>
<p><strong>Play-testing:</strong> Custom races should be play-tested to ensure balance and fun.</p>
<p><strong>Moderation:</strong> Game developers reserve the right to moderate custom races for official data. Personal rules between friends or family groups are always acceptable.</p>`

    classes: {
      title: "Classes",
      body: `<h2>Classes in NDTT</h2>
<p>Unlike traditional RPGs, NDTT doesn't strictly define classes. Instead, classes emerge organically from your ability choices, attribute distribution, and playstyle. However, we provide archetypal class concepts as inspiration and starting points.</p>

<h3>Martial Archetypes</h3>
<p><strong>Warrior</strong> - Focus on STR and DEF, create abilities centered on physical combat and weapon mastery.</p>
<p><strong>Paladin</strong> - Balance STR with WIS/INT, combine physical abilities with supportive or divine-themed powers.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong> - Blend DEF and tactical abilities focused on precision and battlefield control.</p>

<h3>Magical Archetypes</h3>
<p><strong>Wizard</strong> - Maximize INT, invest in high-cost devastating spells that require careful timing.</p>
<p><strong>Sorcerer</strong> - Balance INT with multiple mid-cost abilities for versatility.</p>
<p><strong>Warlock</strong> - Create unique pact-themed abilities with interesting resource costs.</p>
<p><strong>Druid</strong> - Mix WIS-based abilities with nature-themed transformations or summons.</p>

<h3>Support Archetypes</h3>
<p><strong>Cleric</strong> - Focus on WIS, create healing and protective abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Healer</strong> - Specialize entirely in restorative abilities with low costs for consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Bard</strong> - Use CHA, create abilities that buff allies or debuff enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Dancer</strong> - Blend DEF and CHA for movement-based support abilities.</p>

<h3>Specialist Archetypes</h3>
<p><strong>Rogue</strong> - Focus on DEF and STR, create precise strike abilities with tactical advantages.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemist</strong> - Mix INT with utility abilities like buffs, debuffs, and environmental effects.</p>

<h2>Custom Class Guidelines</h2>
<p>The beauty of NDTT is that these are just suggestions. Your "class" is defined by:</p>
<p>• Your attribute distribution</p>
<p>• The abilities you create</p>
<p>• Your playstyle and strategy</p>
<p>• Your character's story and background</p>

<p><strong>Community Contributions:</strong> Players are encouraged to share their unique class concepts, ability combinations, and creative builds. As long as abilities follow the core balance mechanics (higher cost = harder to hit), anything goes!</p>

<p><strong>Balance Philosophy:</strong> The ability point system naturally prevents overpowered builds. If you invest everything in one massive ability, you're vulnerable. If you spread too thin, you lack impact. Finding the sweet spot is part of the game.</p>`
    },
    
    lore: {
      title: "World & Lore",
      body: `<h2>The World of Eternia</h2>
<p>Eternia is a vast and varied world, shaped by powerful forces that have molded its landscapes and its inhabitants.</p>

<h3>Geography</h3>
<p>The world is mostly composed of a large continent that stretches across the northern hemisphere, bordered by vast oceans to the east and west, and towering mountain ranges to the north and south. The central region of the continent is a vast plain, home to many of the world's major settlements and cultures. The eastern and western regions are dotted with rugged hills and deep valleys, making them difficult to traverse.</p>

<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>Climate in Eternia is varied:</p>
<p>• <strong>Northern Regions:</strong> Colder with snowy and icy conditions</p>
<p>• <strong>Southern Regions:</strong> Warmer with tropical forests and deserts</p>
<p>• <strong>Central Region:</strong> Milder, with a mix of deciduous and coniferous forests, grasslands and wetlands</p>

<h3>Weather Patterns</h3>
<p>The northern regions experience long and harsh winters, while the southern regions have long and hot summers. The central region experiences milder seasons with a mix of rain and sunshine throughout the year. The coastlines are affected by strong winds, and storms can be common during certain times of the year. The mountainous regions experience frequent snowfall, making them inhospitable to most life forms.</p>

<h3>Otherworldly Regions</h3>

<h4>The Eternal Storms</h4>
<p>Located on the western coast, this region is characterized by constant storms with lightning and thunder that never subside. The storms are so intense they have formed their own ecosystem, with creatures adapted to survive in such conditions. The area is rich in resources that can harness the power of the storms, making it valuable but extremely dangerous to explore.</p>

<h4>The Eternal Dunes</h4>
<p>A desert region on the southern part of the continent, characterized by immense sand dunes that stretch as far as the eye can see. The dunes constantly shift, making navigation difficult. The extreme heat and lack of water make it inhospitable to most life. However, hidden within the dunes is a secret oasis where water is abundant and creatures and plants that cannot be found anywhere else in Eternia thrive.</p>

<h4>The Eternal Glacier</h4>
<p>A massive glacier located on the northern part of the continent, characterized by freezing temperatures and icy conditions. The glacier is home to a unique ecosystem with creatures and plants adapted to harsh conditions. It's rich in valuable resources like ice and minerals, but constant avalanches and blizzards make it extremely dangerous to explore.</p>

<h4>The Eternal Shadow</h4>
<p>Located in the central region, this biome is rich in corrupted magic and filled with undead and cursed creatures. A thick fog that never lifts makes visibility nearly impossible beyond a few feet. The corrupted magic has twisted the creatures and plants that live there into nightmarish forms.</p>
<p>Home to zombies, skeletons, ghosts, and other terrifying monsters drawn to the corrupt magic. Twisted versions of plants and animals inhabit the region, such as giant carnivorous plants that move on their own and giant spiders that shoot webs of corrosive acid.</p>
<p>Ancient ruins and abandoned temples from before the corruption dot the landscape, filled with traps and dangerous creatures, but also containing powerful artifacts and ancient knowledge. This area is extremely dangerous and not for the faint of heart.</p>

<h2>Urzallism: The Eight Gods</h2>
<p>Urzallism is the primary religion of Eternia, based on the worship of eight gods representing the elements, forces, and energies of the world. These gods were created by the Creator, a being of pure energy and light, who divided itself into eight pieces to better watch over and guide the world.</p>

<h3>The Creation Story</h3>
<p>In a time long forgotten, the Creator looked upon the world and saw that while it was good, it was imperfect and lacking in fundamental ways. The Creator divided itself into eight pieces, each imbued with a different aspect of its power and energy, creating eight powerful gods to watch over different aspects of existence.</p>

<h3>The Eight Gods</h3>

<h4>Arid - Goddess of Air</h4>
<p>A powerful and graceful deity who commands the winds and sky. Often depicted as a beautiful woman with wings riding on the back of a great eagle. Born from the breath of the first living beings, she emerged from the mists of creation and shaped the world by lifting mountains, carving valleys, and creating the sky and clouds.

Born from the tears of the first living beings, she emerged from the depths of the sea and created the rivers, lakes, and filled the oceans with life. Known for kindness, compassion, and healing. A master of rejuvenation who seeks to bring peace and harmony to the world.</p>

<h4>Mark - God of Earth</h4>
<p>A powerful and strong deity who commands the land and forests. Often depicted as a mighty warrior wielding a great axe and riding on the back of a great bear. Born from the first seeds of life, he emerged from the soil and created the forests, mountains, and filled the land with life. Known for strength, courage, fierce loyalty, and unwavering devotion. A master of battle and war who always stands up for what he believes in.</p>

<h4>Jarius - God of Fire</h4>
<p>A powerful and fiery deity who commands flames and heat. Often depicted as a fierce dragon who breathes fire and roars with power. Born from the first sparks of life, he emerged from the depths of the earth and created volcanoes, lightning, and filled the world with heat and light. Known for passion, energy, boldness, and daring. A master of creativity and innovation who seeks to push boundaries and explore new horizons.</p>

<h4>Seishin - God of Spirit</h4>
<p>A powerful and wise deity who commands the essence of life and the power of the soul. Often depicted as a wise old man carrying a staff and a book of knowledge. Born from the first whispers of life, he emerged from the realm of the spirits and created the concepts of good and evil, filling the world with meaning and purpose. Known for wisdom, insight, and deep understanding of the spiritual realm. A master of divination and prophecy who helps others find their path in life.</p>

<h4>Hikari - God of Light</h4>
<p>A powerful and radiant deity who commands the sun and stars. Often depicted as a shining sun radiating warmth and light. Born from the first glimmers of life, he emerged from the darkness and created day and night, filling the world with light and warmth. Known for radiance, warmth, generosity, and kindness. A master of growth and prosperity who seeks to bring hope and happiness to the world.</p>

<h4>Avarielle - Goddess of Darkness</h4>

Known for cunning, intelligence, and hidden knowledge. A master of deception and manipulation who seeks to keep the balance between light and darkness.</p>

<h4>Kontiferus - God of Judgement</h4>
<p>A powerful and just deity who commands the scales of justice and the fate of mortals. Often depicted as a great judge sitting on a throne of gold, holding the scales of justice. Born from the first thoughts of justice and fairness, he emerged from the realm of the gods and created laws and morals, filling the world with justice and righteousness. Known as the Karma Enforcer - fair and impartial, but stern and unyielding. A master of justice and judgement who upholds the law and brings justice to those who deserve it.</p>

<h3>Worship and Practice</h3>
<p>Urzallism teaches that these eight gods represent the eight pillars of a good life. Followers pay respects through good deeds, kindness, acceptance, understanding, love, diversity, respect, and freedom.</p>

<p><strong>Making Requests:</strong> To make a request or prayer, one must first do something nice for someone or something beneficial to better the world. If the request is not founded in hatred and is within the god's power, it will be granted. The believer's faith greatly affects the outcome.</p>

<p><strong>Divine Philosophy:</strong> The gods do not play favorites and focus on love of all things while maintaining a healthy balance of chaos. They are not infallible and are subject to the same weaknesses and flaws as mortals, making them relatable guides rather than distant overlords.</p>

<p><strong>Warning About Kontiferus:</strong> He should only be invoked when absolutely necessary. If invoked for personal judgement, he will not hesitate to judge the invoker as well. He is the God of Judgement and does not take his role lightly.</p>

<h3>Elemental Affinities and the Gods</h3>
<p>The elemental affinity system in NDTT directly mirrors the eight gods of Urzallism:</p>
<p>• Air Affinity → Arid</p>
<p>• Water Affinity → Tori</p>
<p>• Earth Affinity → Mark</p>
<p>• Fire Affinity → Jarius</p>
<p>• Spirit Affinity → Seishin</p>
<p>• Light Affinity → Hikari</p>
<p>• Dark Affinity → Avarielle</p>
<p>• Judgement → Kontiferus</p>

<p>Characters with high affinity to an element may feel a stronger connection to their corresponding deity, and the gods may take particular interest in those who embody their domain.</p>

<h2>Historical Notes</h2>
<p>As the centuries passed, the gods of Urzallism grew in power and influence, granting blessings to the good and righteous, and punishing those who were not. Eventually their power began to fade, and they retreated to their own realms, leaving the world to its own devices. However, their legacy lives on, and their followers continue to worship them and pray for their blessings. Though the gods may have retreated, their power still remains, waiting for those who are worthy to call upon them once again.</p>`
