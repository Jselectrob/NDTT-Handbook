              body: `<h2>About This Game</h2>
<p>NDTT (Non-Descript Table Top RPG) is a community-driven fantasy role-playing game that empowers players to create their own custom classes, races, backstories, items, weapons, campaigns, and abilities. The core philosophy is creative freedom balanced with fair gameplay.</p>

<h3>What Makes This Different?</h3>
<p>NDTT features a unique Ability Point system that allows players to literally build their own abilities from scratch. Every character is truly unique, shaped by the player's imagination and strategic choices. The game grows with your character across multiple campaigns, creating a persistent hero that ages and evolves with you.</p>

<h3>Character Creation Overview</h3>
<p>Characters are built using six core attributes and a pool of Ability Points that you spend to create your own custom abilities. Higher-cost abilities are more powerful but harder to successfully execute, creating natural balance through risk vs. reward.</p>

<h3>Campaign Persistence</h3>
<p>Your character is locked during a campaign but carries forward to future adventures. Between campaigns, you can respec abilities, allowing your character to grow and adapt while maintaining continuity across your gaming experience.</p>`

            rules: {
              title: "Core Rules",
              body: `<h2>Core Attributes</h2>
<p>Every character has six core attributes that define their capabilities:</p>

<p><strong>Strength (STR)</strong> - Physical power and combat prowess. Adds directly to physical damage dealt.</p>

<p><strong>Defense (DEF)</strong> - Overall defensive capability, encompassing dodge, armor, and damage reduction.</p>

<p><strong>Vitality (VIT)</strong> - Health points (HP). Determines how much damage you can take before falling.</p>

<p><strong>Intelligence (INT)</strong> - Mental acuity and magical power. Adds directly to magic-based damage.</p>

<p><strong>Wisdom (WIS)</strong> - Perception, insight, and magical understanding. Adds directly to magic-based damage.</p>

<p><strong>Charisma (CHA)</strong> - Force of personality, persuasiveness, and leadership ability.</p>

<h2>Ability Point System</h2>
<p>The heart of NDTT's character customization is the Ability Point system. Players use these points to create their own unique abilities.</p>

<h3>Ability Point Progression</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Points:</strong> 10 ability points at character creation</p>
<p><strong>Level Gain:</strong> +2 ability points per level</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Cap:</strong> 30 ability points total</p>

<h3>Creating Abilities</h3>
<p>When you create an ability, you spend ability points from your pool. The more points you invest, the more powerful the ability becomes.</p>

<p><strong>Important Balance Mechanic:</strong> Higher-cost abilities are more powerful but HARDER to successfully execute. They require higher dice rolls to hit/succeed, creating a natural risk vs. reward system.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> If you spend all 10 starting points on one devastating ability, it will be incredibly powerful but very difficult to land without a high roll. Alternatively, you could create five 2-point abilities that are weaker but more reliable.</p>

<h3>Using Abilities in Combat</h3>
<p>When you use an ability, it costs resources (typically HP, Defense, or other stats). The player chooses what resource is consumed based on the nature of the ability - a blood magic spell might cost HP, while a defensive technique might temporarily reduce Defense.</p>

<p><strong>Dice Resolution:</strong> NDTT uses a d20 for ability checks and combat resolution.</p>

<h3>Ability Modifications</h3>
<p><strong>During Campaign:</strong> Characters are locked - you cannot respec existing abilities, but you CAN create new abilities as you gain ability points from leveling.</p>

<p><strong>Between Campaigns:</strong> Before starting a new campaign, you can respec your abilities, changing their power and cost to better fit your evolving strategy.</p>

<h2>Combat System</h2>
<p>NDTT uses a traditional turn-based combat system with d20 resolution.</p>

<h2>Character Advancement</h2>
<p>Characters level up through experience, gaining +2 ability points per level. Your character persists across campaigns, aging and growing more powerful with each adventure.</p>

<h2>Mechanics In Development</h2>
<p>The following systems are still being refined:</p>
<p>• Exact ability power scaling formulas</p>
<p>• Minimum/maximum damage ranges based on ability point investment</p>
<p>• Elemental affinity integration</p>
<p>• Detailed combat mechanics</p>`

            races: {
              title: "Races",
              body: `<h2>Available Races</h2>
<p>The following races are currently available in NDTT. Each race has unique abilities and traits.</p>

<h3>Human</h3>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium | <strong>Speed:</strong> 30ft</p>
<p>Versatile and adaptable. The baseline race against which all others are measured.</p>

<h3>Eternasoul</h3>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium | <strong>Speed:</strong> 40ft (walking, burrowing), variable (climbing, flying, swimming)</p>
<p><strong>Special Traits:</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Inhabitation:</strong> Can inhabit the body of a dead creature as a bonus action, gaining access to its physical abilities and senses. While inhabited, the Eternasoul is invisible. Can remain in a host for up to 1 hour before returning to ethereal form.</p>
<p>• <strong>Ethereal Form:</strong> Can return to ethereal form as a bonus action, becoming transparent and immune to non-magical weapons. In this form, can move through solid objects and has a fly speed of 30ft.</p>
<p>• <strong>Energy Synergy:</strong> When inhabiting a host, can merge energy with the host to gain access to new abilities (determined by DM).</p>
<p>• <strong>Darkvision:</strong> Can see in the dark up to 60ft.</p>
<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Eternasoul and one other language of your choice</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Ancient energy-based creatures from a dimension of complete darkness. After a catastrophic event, they fled to Eternia using a powerful energy-katana created by the inventor Exota. Now trapped in Eternia, they search for answers about their forced migration and seek either a way to return home or a new purpose in this world.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 20px;"><em>Note: Additional races including Eternagolem, Squishion, Pickled Squishion, Fungion, Toxic Fungion, Fungiclad, Lumichen, Lumilichen, Roshuman, and Smogblimb are available. Full details coming soon!</em></p>

<h2>Custom Race Guidelines</h2>
<p><strong>Balance:</strong> Custom races should be balanced with pre-existing races. They should not have abilities or traits that are overwhelmingly powerful.</p>
<p><strong>Game Lore Continuity:</strong> Custom races should fit within the existing game lore and world-building. They should have a proper backstory, culture, and place in the game's existing world (or custom world).</p>
<p><strong>Game Experience:</strong> Custom races should enhance the game experience for all players and not detract from it.</p>
<p><strong>Realism:</strong> Custom races should be believable within the context of the game's fantasy setting. They should have clear and consistent explanations of their abilities and traits.</p>
<p><strong>Originality:</strong> Custom races should be original. Inspiration is encouraged, but if making a sub-race or offshoot of someone else's design, they must be credited.</p>
<p><strong>Play-testing:</strong> Custom races should be play-tested to ensure balance and fun.</p>
<p><strong>Moderation:</strong> Game developers reserve the right to moderate custom races for official data. Personal rules between friends or family groups are always acceptable.</p>`

            classes: {
              title: "Classes",
              body: `<h2>Classes in NDTT</h2>
<p>Unlike traditional RPGs, NDTT doesn't strictly define classes. Instead, classes emerge organically from your ability choices, attribute distribution, and playstyle. However, we provide archetypal class concepts as inspiration and starting points.</p>

<h3>Martial Archetypes</h3>
<p><strong>Warrior</strong> - Focus on STR and DEF, create abilities centered on physical combat and weapon mastery.</p>
<p><strong>Paladin</strong> - Balance STR with WIS/INT, combine physical abilities with supportive or divine-themed powers.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong> - Blend DEF and tactical abilities focused on precision and battlefield control.</p>

<h3>Magical Archetypes</h3>
<p><strong>Wizard</strong> - Maximize INT, invest in high-cost devastating spells that require careful timing.</p>
<p><strong>Sorcerer</strong> - Balance INT with multiple mid-cost abilities for versatility.</p>
<p><strong>Warlock</strong> - Create unique pact-themed abilities with interesting resource costs.</p>
<p><strong>Druid</strong> - Mix WIS-based abilities with nature-themed transformations or summons.</p>

<h3>Support Archetypes</h3>
<p><strong>Cleric</strong> - Focus on WIS, create healing and protective abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Healer</strong> - Specialize entirely in restorative abilities with low costs for consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Bard</strong> - Use CHA, create abilities that buff allies or debuff enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Dancer</strong> - Blend DEF and CHA for movement-based support abilities.</p>

<h3>Specialist Archetypes</h3>
<p><strong>Rogue</strong> - Focus on DEF and STR, create precise strike abilities with tactical advantages.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemist</strong> - Mix INT with utility abilities like buffs, debuffs, and environmental effects.</p>

<h2>Custom Class Guidelines</h2>
<p>The beauty of NDTT is that these are just suggestions. Your "class" is defined by:</p>
<p>• Your attribute distribution</p>
<p>• The abilities you create</p>
<p>• Your playstyle and strategy</p>
<p>• Your character's story and background</p>

<p><strong>Community Contributions:</strong> Players are encouraged to share their unique class concepts, ability combinations, and creative builds. As long as abilities follow the core balance mechanics (higher cost = harder to hit), anything goes!</p>

<p><strong>Balance Philosophy:</strong> The ability point system naturally prevents overpowered builds. If you invest everything in one massive ability, you're vulnerable. If you spread too thin, you lack impact. Finding the sweet spot is part of the game.</p>`

              title: "Mechanics Workshop",
              body: `<h2>Ability Creation Testing Ground</h2>
<p>This section is for experimenting with different formulas and mechanics for the Ability Point system.</p>

<h3>Core Questions Being Explored</h3>

<h4>1. Ability Power Scaling</h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How does ability point cost translate to power?</p>
<p><strong>Options being tested:</strong></p>
<p>• Linear scaling (2 points = 2d6 damage, 4 points = 4d6 damage)</p>
<p>• Exponential scaling (2 points = 1d8, 4 points = 3d8, 8 points = 7d8)</p>
<p>• Tiered system (1-3 points = Tier 1, 4-6 = Tier 2, 7-10 = Tier 3)</p>

<h4>2. Success Difficulty</h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How much harder should high-cost abilities be to hit?</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong></p>
<p>• DC = 10 + (Ability Cost)</p>
<p>• DC = 8 + (Ability Cost × 1.5)</p>
<p>• Flat tiers based on cost ranges</p>

<h4>3. Damage Range Formula</h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Should abilities have minimum guaranteed damage?</p>

<h4>4. Resource Cost Formulas</h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How much HP/DEF/etc should using an ability cost?</p>

<h3>Example Ability Builds to Test</h3>
<p><strong>The Glass Cannon (10-point ability)</strong> - Maximum damage but very hard to hit</p>
<p><strong>The Specialist (5+5)</strong> - Two medium abilities for balance</p>
<p><strong>The Versatile (5×2)</strong> - Multiple reliable abilities</p>

<h3>Community Input Needed</h3>
<p>Have ideas for ability formulas? Tested a build? Share your findings to help refine the system!</p>`
